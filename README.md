# Pixel Chaos: A Reddit r/Place Clone

## What Is This Madness?

Welcome to yet another project that will probably never be finished! Your friendly neighbors decided they weren't frustrated enough with their day jobs and needed to bang their heads against entirely new technologies. Thus, this project was born.

## Project "Goals"

We're building this r/Place clone not because it's practical, but because:

1. We wanted to see how many different technologies we could cram into one project before it collapses under its own weight
2. It seemed like a great way to procrastinate on learning things that would actually advance our careers
3. One of us saw a YouTube video about WebSockets and now we're "experts"

## Tech Stack of Doom

* **Backend**: FastAPI (because Flask is so 2018)
* **Frontend**: React/Next.js (we'll probably switch frameworks halfway through)
* **Database**: MongoDB (we don't have a PhD for ACID compliance)
* **Infrastructure**: Pulumi (because we hate ourselves just enough to learn declarative infrastructure)
* **Deployment**: Wherever the wind takes us (probably AWS until we see the bill)
* **Cache**: Redis (the only technology we're both equally confused by)

## Current Status

- [x] Create ambitious README
- [x] Set up project structure with more directories than we'll ever use
- [ ] Actually write any significant code
- [ ] Figure out how WebSockets work
- [ ] Implement user authentication (will probably just use "admin:admin")
- [ ] Create the canvas (we're considering just using MS Paint)
- [ ] Deploy to production (aka one of our laptops)
- [ ] Invite friends to use it (spoiler: they won't)

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YeetTheCode/pixel-chaos.git

# Run the development in (TBD in a long future)
docker-compose up

# Watch it crash
docker-compose down
```

## Contributing

Please don't. We have enough problems already. But if you insist:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/why-would-you-do-this`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some "feature"'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/why-would-you-do-this`)
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Watch as we ignore it for months

## Acknowledgments

* Stack Overflow, without which we would have accomplished nothing
* Caffeine, our primary debugging tool
* The original r/Place creators, who had a much better idea of what they were doing
